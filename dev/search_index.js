But the epochs corresponding to these occurrences will not be part of the NREM period. For example, in a stage sequence of the form\n\n... - 10m of stage two - 1m of REM - 5m of stage three - 5m of REM - ...\n\nthe NREM period consists of the first 10 minutes of stage 2 and the 5 minutes of stage 3, ignoring the 1 minute of REM in-between them.\n\nImportantly, the restriction that ending REM periods must last at least 5 minutes is not imposed when detecting the first and the last NREM period in a night of sleep.","category":"section"},{"location":"#NREM-detection-algorithm","page":"Home","title":"NREM detection algorithm","text":"Let n be the number of epochs corresponding to 15 minutes and m the number of epochs corresponding to 5 minutes.

Calling artifact detection functions without RCall installed will result in  an error and a prompt to install RCall.\n\nCAPA is an automated anomaly detection algorithm which performs in linear time and is specifically designed for time series analysis. The adaptation provided in this package detects epidemic changes in the mean of each segment of the EEG, where the segment length is a parameter. The algorithm is relatively fast, considering the high complexity of EEG recordings.\n\nFor instance, on a 15.5 million samples EEG record with 8 channels (all artifact-detected), with a segment length of 30 * 5 seconds, the algorithm took ≈8.6 minutes on a computer with an I3 processor and 8GB of RAM. That's 8.6/8 = 1.075 minutes per channel, i.e. practically a minute per each 15.5 million-sized vector, on a mediocre computer.","category":"section"},{"location":"#Resampling","page":"Home","title":"Resampling","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"#Helpers","page":"Home","title":"Helpers","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"#Examples","page":"Home","title":"Examples","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"#Resampling-2","page":"Home","title":"Resampling","text":"file = \"myeeg.edf\" \neeg = EEG(file)\nsignal = get_channel(eeg, \"EEG6\")\nresampled = resample(signal, 10.0) # Resample signal to 10Hz.\np1 = plot_ts(signal, 30, 30) # Plot epoch 30\np2 = plot_ts(resampled, 30, 30) # Plot epoch 30\n\np = plot(p1, p2, layout=(2, 1), link=:x, legend=false)\n\n(Image: )","category":"section"},{"location":"#Hypnogram","page":"Home","title":"Hypnogram","text":"staging = CSV.read(\"staging.csv\", DataFrame) # Some staging data\nreplace!(staging, \"NS\" => \"?\", \"REM\" => \"5\", \"WK\" => \"6\", \"N1\" => \"1\", \"N2\" => \"2\", \"N3\" => \"3\", \"N4\" => \"4\") # Convert it to appropriate format (see Staging data type)\nstaging = Staging(staging) # Convert to Staging data type\np = plot_hypnogram(staging) # Plot\n\n(Image: )","category":"section"},{"location":"#Artifact-detection-2","page":"Home","title":"Artifact detection","text":"Consider the REPL commands below, which read an EEG from an EDF file, perform artifact detection on each 5min segment of the EEG channel EEG6, and plots the artifacts from epochs 30 to 60 with annotations.\n\njulia> file = \"SWAIVF004.edf\" \n\"SWAIVF004.edf\"\njulia> eeg = EEG(file)\njulia> detect_artifacts(eeg, \"EEG6\", 60*5)  # epoch length = 5 minutes\njulia> get_artifacts(eeg) # Just to show what changes after running `detect artifacts`  on channel EEG6.\nDict{String, Union{Nothing, Vector{Artifact}}} with 11 entries:\n  \"Light\"    => nothing\n  \"Sound\"    => nothing\n  \"HR\"       => nothing\n  \"PAT\"      => nothing\n  \"Head Pos\" => nothing\n  \"EEG6\"     => Artifact[Artifact((1, 152), 33.1202, 5034.28, 1, 1), Artifact((173, 283), 9.70824, 1077.61, 1, 1), Artifact((23575, 23610), 32.582, 1172.95, 11, 1), Artifact((24197, …\n  \"EEG5\"     => nothing\n  ⋮          => ⋮\n\njulia> plot_artifacts_in_epochs(eeg, \"EEG6\", 30, 60; annotate=true)\n\n(Image: )","category":"section"},{"location":"#Spectrogram","page":"Home","title":"Spectrogram","text":"file = \"myeeg.edf\" \neeg = EEG(file)\nsignal = get_channel(eeg, \"EEG6\")\npsd = x -> PSD(x, signal.fs, signal.fs * 5)\nS = Spectrogram(signal, x -> custom_psd(x, signal.fs))\n\nplot_spectrogram(S; type::Int=2) # Type 2 for 3D plot.\n\n(Image: )","category":"section"},{"location":"#NREM-delta-power","page":"Home","title":"NREM delta power","text":"This is an example script for computing the mean delta (delta) power in each of the NREM periods of a sleep EEG.

This analysis procedure  succesfully replicated results from Washington State University in collaboration with the developer's laboratory at UPenn. \n\nThe standardized procedure is as follows: split the signal into 30-sec epochs, each of which is split into 5-sec sub-epochs. Each epoch's spectrum is the  aggregated spectra from its sub-epochs; the signal's spectrum is the aggregated  spectra from its epochs. Rectangular window is used. Overlap is set to zero. No normalization is performed.\n\n\n\n\n\nanalyze_eeg(signal::Vector{<:AbstractFloat}, fs::Integer, epoch_indexes::Vector{<:Integer})::Spectrogram\n\nPerform a standardized analysis of the specified epochs of an EEG signal.

On each segment, the CAPA algorithm (Fisch et. al 2022) is used  to detect epidemic distributional changes in the mean value of the segment.  The penalty is an integer value β such that β ln(n) (with n the segment's length)  is the penalty used by the CAPA algorithm to penalize the introduction of artifacts. The β penalty defaults to 24, which is much higher than the value recommended  in Fisch et. al but matched human supervision on 78Hz sleep EEGs at the  developer's laboratory. \n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"function"},{"location":"#EEGToolkit.plot_artifacts_in_epochs","page":"Home","title":"EEGToolkit.plot_artifacts_in_epochs","text":"function plot_artifacts_in_epochs(signal::TimeSeries, artifacts::ArtifactData,                                    from::Integer, to::Integer;                                    annotate::Bool=false)\n\nGiven a signal and a non-empty vector of artifacts, plots the signal and highlights the existing artifacts from epoch from to epoch to.
